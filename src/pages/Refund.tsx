              We offer refunds for services purchased within 14 days of payment under specific conditions. To request a refund, please contact us within this 14-day period with your order number and the reason for your request. Refunds will only be granted if the service was not provided as described or if the service has not been accessed or used. Note that we do not offer refunds for digital products or services that have already been accessed or used. Customized services created specifically for you are also non-refundable.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              A transaction fee of up to 10% may be deducted from the refund amount to cover bank or credit card processing fees.

              If a refund is approved, it will be credited to the original payment method. Please allow up to 10 business days for the refund to be processed and reflected in your account. Refunds cannot be issued after the 30-day period has expired. For any questions regarding our refund policy, please contact us.

              For cancellations requested before the service has been provided, a partial refund may be available. No refund will be granted if the service has already been delivered. If we request additional information and more than 30 days have passed since the order, no refund will be issued. Once a service has been initiated or processed, orders cannot be adjusted or canceled. In the event of cancellation or dispute after payment, you will be responsible for reimbursing us for all fees incurred during service preparation, including the original quoted cost and sales tax.

              In cases of pricing or description errors on our website, we reserve the right to cancel or refuse orders placed at incorrect prices. If your account has been charged for a purchase and the order is canceled due to such an error, we will issue a credit for the incorrect amount charged.
